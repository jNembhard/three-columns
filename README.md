## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Adobe XD (Framing)

### What I learned

I was able to vastly speed up my creation process by using framing tools to map out the design before build. I usuallt have been focusing on improving my web design ski directly, but it is important to plan the process out before hand. This allows me to see everything before a design to see if I a have a good plan to execute.

I also found it is better to design for the smallest width of mobile first and then increase the size gradually instead of starting at 768px. This means starting with around a max-width of 375px and then increasing the width. This ensures that the layout will look good on all screen sizes.
